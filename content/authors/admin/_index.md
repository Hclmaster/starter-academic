Hello! My name is Chenghong, currently I'm a first year PhD student studying Artificial Intelligence at Northwestern University. I became a PhD student from Fall 2020 in [Qualitative Reasoning Group (QRG)](https://www.qrg.northwestern.edu/) led by [Ken Forbus](https://users.cs.northwestern.edu/~forbus/). My current research interests lie in the realm of reasoning systems and natural language processing, and how they can be applied to handle commonsense reasoning tasks.

During my free time, I usually run 2-3 miles on a daily basis and I occassionally read books as well.
